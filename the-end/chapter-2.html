<pre><code>If the tool is not fit for the job at hand, make a new tool.
I am the tool, and the maker? and maybe also the job????

- Me on LSD
</code></pre>
<p>So let’s get this out of the way, this arc started with a bad mushroom trip. Whether or not I’m proud of this I’ll leave up to interpretation. Regardless, one life altering experience was bound to leave me wanting more, so more I sought. First, LSD, then more mushrooms, then DMT, MDMA, then back to mushrooms. Every experience brought with it something new, something a new perspective, a wider view, a deeper truth.</p>
<p>These experiences didn’t just alter my mind, they changed who I was. Fundamental parts of my experience have been altered and likely will remain altered for some time. After the first mushroom trip, I started having brief flashbacks where I suddenly felt strange and slightly anxious. LSD altered my experience of music and likely gave me a very mild form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallucinogen_persisting_perception_disorder">HPPD</a>. DMT made me believe in an afterlife. My second mushrooms experience gave me altered interoception and ability to access and harness my emotions in ways I had not before. Finally, MDMA gave me one very slight memory alteration, which I only realized recently.</p>
<p>In church, I remember an analogy about a frog sitting in water as the water slowly heats up. The frog doesn’t react and eventually boils to death. In retrospect, it seems possible that I was that frog. Each individual change or experience wasn’t a deal breaker, and each experience, as it came along, didn’t strike me as overly risky.</p>
<p>With the benefit of hindsight, I now begin to see other ways these drugs effected me. There is an inherent opportunity cost to doing drugs when you could instead be doing something else. Now I only ever did these when the bulk of my responsibilities were taken care of, which protected me from most outright harm, but as I sit here now looking back. I realize I have gained not much of substance for the time given to these substances. I could have used that time to work on my biggest issue, my lack of social connection and community. Instead, staying inside to get high only cements these problems. I find myself with no people around me, feeling very lost and alone in light of all of this.</p>
<p>My drug use is also intertwined with a choice I made in my relationship I came to regret, and likely harmed it in other ways too. Now as I re-evaluate my relationship with substances, and face challenges with my relationship (we’ll get to that later), I find it challenging to move forward while feeling like I’ve wasted so much potential because of my own stupidity.</p>
<p>We often know the truth of a situation, even as we’re unable to admit it to ourselves. I often would find myself thinking “I wish I had a friends to do drugs with”. Even as my distorted priorities placed the importance on the drugs and not the friends, and even as that very drug use was one potential obstacle to me fulfilling my desire for connection, I knew what I needed.</p>
