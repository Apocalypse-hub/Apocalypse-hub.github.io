<pre><code>Till Death Do Us Part

me and this thing called being
together forever
or more precise
till my soul frays,
body rots,
bones collapse
or eternity
whichever comes last

poem by me
</code></pre>
<p>When I met Jocelyn I was on the up-and-up, with a newfound hope and newfound purpose. Even still, I could hardly believe how well things went. Up to that point, any romantic endeavor had been fraught with all sorts of problems. I hardly knew myself well enough to meaningfully pursue anyone else. But this time, it felt different. It felt like, on the one hand, all my hard work and self growth was finally paying off, and on the other, I had finally gotten lucky enough to meet someone with which my values and communication style aligned with enough that I had a real shot of making a good connection. As our time together drew on, we were able to progress fairly quickly. It was clear we got along well and had real attraction to each other.</p>
<p>There was one small wrinkle, both of us had colleges across the state from each other to go to at the conclusion of the summer.  When the time came for summer to end, I started to lose control of my emotions. Feeling so many big feelings so quickly left me in a place where I was unsure of what to do next. We talked about it and I tried to ensure we could keep in touch, even as we moved apart.</p>
<p>We began a long distance romance, complete with constant texting, letters, and weekend dives to see each other. One weekend, in the city of Nephi, after a movie and some kissing, Jocelyn asked if she could be my girlfriend. Instinctually, subconsciously, I resisted. I couldn’t explain it at the time, but deep down I must have know that the foundation wasn’t solid enough, we weren’t close enough as friends, that there wasn’t a strong enough <em>reason</em> to be together, at least not yet. I said yes. It is precisely that moment, that decision, that distortion of reality, that put me on a path to one day reckon with its karma. The “debt to the truth” had been incurred.</p>
<p>I spent the next 2 months distorting myself and the truth, making rationalization after rationalization as to why everything was fine and that the relationship was as it should be. There were of course problems and signs but these were easy to ignore with my tremendous ability to essentially self-gaslight. Only when I was faced with a contradiction I could not reconcile, did the house of cards finally collapse off its shaky foundation.</p>
<p>I considered the future, which is a useful tool when determining if you are acting in truth. If something is good now, it won’t lead you to somewhere that isn’t good later. I recognized that, for me, the relationship couldn’t/wouldn’t go on into very long. It good for now, but any long term reality seemed impossible. The investment couldn’t be that high for me, while it seemed to almost already be for her.</p>
<p>Once I recognized this contradiction I knew I really only had two options, ride out a relationship that my heart wasn’t truly in. Likely slowly wearing it thin as resentment grew on both sides before an inevitable falling off, or tear the band-aid off now and break the heart of a person I genuinely care for. I knew what I had to do.</p>
<p>I don’t want to be a person who lives a lie, but I also don’t want to be a person who breaks someone’s heart, where does that leave me. A person who can’t reconcile past actions, extended to present circumstances with current values. That makes me not myself. It makes me trapped between the me who lies, to myself and others, and me who lives honestly. As I prepared to break up, I sought to understand how this could have happened, how I could be caught between worlds of good and evil.</p>
<p>I thought back to that moment, the distortion of reality that I would be forced to pay for. Why, how could it happen? I saw then what I felt throughout the relationship, a lack of ‘should’, a missing reason. Up to the point when we made things official, there was nothing ‘wrong’ about our relationship, but there was also nothing ‘right’. There was no onus, no imperative to make and build something beautiful. For me, our relationship was not to be built and cherished, but to be merely accepted and enjoyed.</p>
<p>I see now that this is not enough. If evil is lack of good, and good is presence, righteous being. Halfway between evil and good, neutrality, something that doesn’t insist upon itself yet doesn’t pull from light inherently, is evil the same. Any way but the right way is the wrong way. The twilight between good and evil is an inherently unstable contradiction that will only lead to evil in the long run.</p>
<pre><code>There is no neutral ground in the universe;
every square inch, every split second,
is claimed by God and counter-claimed by Satan.

- C.S. Lewis

<p>And so we close the book, on contradiction, on this arc, and on my relationship. I payed the debt in what was perhaps the most soul crushing conversation of my life. I will never forget this, and hopefully nor will I forget the lessons it taught me. The lack of anything bad is not the presence of anything good.</p>
<p>More broadly, this culminates many lessons for me that I will distill here. Life is a continual process of becoming and unbecoming. Every moment comes to pass, i.e. comes for the purpose of passing. This limited scope of life is merely the opportunity to be and become as we see fit. Any and everything we do is ultimately temporary, which is not less reason to make it as good and as right and as true as we can, it is more. In seeking to maximize our existence, know that there is somewhere you are going, and act knowing where your actions will take you, fully embracing every obstacle, setback, and outcome. When one thing ends, begin the next in earnest. There is no time to waste and always more places to be. Every ending a new beginning, until The End.</p>
<p>I write this as the clock ticks towards zero. My end, and my new beginning approaches. I make use of the time that is left, and look forward to the time that remains.</p>
<p>Thank you for reading.</p>
<pre><code>And all things end  
All that we intend is scrawled in sand  
Or slips right through our hands  
And just knowing  
That everything will end  
Should not change our plans  
When we begin again

- Hozier, All Things End
