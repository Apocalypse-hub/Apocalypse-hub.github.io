<pre><code>No man ever steps in the same river twice, for it's not the same river
and he's not the same man.

<p>It is only fitting in concluding something, one must return to it’s point of origin. To understand where you are, you must understand where you came from, so lets go back. As the astute may have noticed, this is The End Of All Things… part 2. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7rpF9hzgSqnsWpqfZ3InPP">The End Of All Things Part 1</a> is a playlist I made at the conclusion of my Senior year of highschool. It concluded my most significant arc, which began in earnest in my Junior year.</p>
<p>The soul of a man is not static. Heuristically, we may imagine ourselves static entities that move through and act on the world, this is not so. We are of the world and above it at once. As the world churns, the atoms flinging and dancing about, echoing out from the big bang, we churn, change, and dance with them, for we are them. A human being (this term gives the game away, ‘being’ implies time which implies change) can be thought of as a process, a structure arising from the chaos of existence that ebbs and flows and eventually collapses back to be one with it’s creator.</p>
<p>In this sense, we all die and are reborn all the time. As naturally as we breathe, we die. In this process of dying and being born again, we sometimes can lose large parts of ourselves. Huge swaths or planks of our being may be discarded, rearranged, or rewritten. Often this is done slowly, which gives us the illusion that our soul maintains some essential nature. Other times this happens very rapidly and leaves us suddenly made new, suddenly apart from ourselves, suddenly reborn.</p>
<p>I was reborn, for the first time, over the course of about a month over the summer. As if I was a living Ship of Theseus, I tore one plank after another from myself, and began to replace them with new planks, better planks. This turned out to only be partially true, but I’m getting ahead of myself.</p>
<p>I was finally reborn, finally free from the self imposed shackles of a mind tailored for survival instead of life. One by one, I ripped out the strands of my soul that did not serve me. My uncertainty became a belief in the necessity of action despite doubt. My lack of confidence was exposed for what it had always been, a fear of failure and I begin to act in faith of building understanding and self worth through experience. Unsurprisingly, things improved rapidly and dramatically. It’s amazing how much of a bad experience can be attributed to a bad mindset. Reality is, to a large extent, simply a mirror for it’s observer. We don’t see things as they are, we see them as we are.</p>
<p>And what a pleasure it was to be what I was. Renewed, invigorated, excited, but ultimately, naïve. For though I was now the me who gave myself my best experience of this life yet, my soul was not free from the me who withheld it to begin with. To liberate your soul implies a force which it must have been liberated from, but you are never truly liberated from yourself. Failing to recognize this was my first mistake.</p>
<p>Just as the road to hell is paved with good intentions, the road to My End was paved with mistake after mistake, each brought on by my own inability to see the truth when I wanted to see what I thought was my life improving. This weekend, these mistakes and this road leads me to another end, and another beginning. I shall be liberated from the me that brought me here, and left with a me that’s being shall be defined through forging whatever strands of hope and determination remain to piece together a me worth being, a soul worth it’s potential.</p>
<p>Until The End is here, there is more reflection to do, more to know, more debts to be paid, and more truth to be revealed. A complicated web of desperation, lust, and poor substance use to untangle, and a future of dread, dissolution, and acceptance to create, so join me for Chapter 2 dear reader. Tomorrow. In the meantime, know The End approaches still, for me and for you.</p>
