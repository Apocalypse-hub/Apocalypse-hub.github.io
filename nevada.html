<p><code>Part I - Maria's Kind of a Piece of Shit</code><br>
We can start there I think. She’s not a good partner, she’s not a good friend, and she’s not a good employee. Now I don’t dream of labor either, but going 0/3 on your most important relationships is worth mentioning.</p>
<p>That first scene where she fakes enjoying sex with her girlfriend Steph is kind of a metaphor for the whole thing right? She’s doing the thing so absentmindedly that she’s not even sure why she’s not doing it anymore. It’s her whole life.</p>
<p>One thing to another its decisions rooted in no value system. It's even revealed that her supposed life changing turn (in which she lies to and steals from her ex, impulse buys $400 of heroin, and forcefully projects her unlived life and associated feelings onto an egg in no position to play their role in Maria's ego fantasy) is little more than another addition to the list of empty gestures that Maria fills her life with. Whatever.</p>
<p><code>Part II - I Love Her Anyway</code><br>
Inside all the rambling Maria does in her head. There are real nuggets of wisdom and truth. She seemingly knows everything except how to actually make what she wants happen. It’s kind of endearing how helpless she is, and she even seems to accept that on some level. She’s a perfectly comedic character because she doesn’t know she’s in a drama.</p>
<p><code>Part III - So What Does This Mean For Nevada?</code><br>
By centering its narrative on a character who is genuinely marginalized (and aware of that marginalization), but also deeply dysfunctional, Nevada builds its ending into its beginning. The structure of Maria’s mind in the opening pages is laid out clearly. She’s inside a personally curated closed loop. Once the reader knows the engine that powers its leading lady, the story is free to step back and let you watch her drive away.</p>
