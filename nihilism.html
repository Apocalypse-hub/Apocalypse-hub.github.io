      <h1 id="preamble">Preamble</h1>
<p>Ah, Nihilism, oh how you delight and entreat the masses. Your fame and infamy grand in equal measure. For a silly ideology, I basically straight-up agree with most of the core tenants and premises on display here. I find many of these ideas to be deeply compelling and seemingly true. This does not mean I am in favor of the proverbial “Black Pill” (either giving up on life or outright killing oneself). I plan to cover why I think that life is, in fact, worth living and seeing through to it’s conclusion in almost all cases. I’ll probably do this in a future note called something like “The Case For Giving a Shit” or something similar.</p>
<p>In short, here in this note I’m going to argue for the following (very nihilistic) ideas: “There are no moral facts.” and “All facts are unknowable.” The purpose of this is, as mentioned before, not to be pro-black pill. I simply find these arguments compelling.</p>
<h1 id="morality-is-fake--gay">Morality is Fake &amp; Gay</h1>
<p>I don’t believe in objective morality, I don’t think it exists, I don’t even know if it <em>can</em> exist frankly. Let’s talk about that. There are a few different ways to phrase this kind of belief, I think there are technically semantic differences between them but I basically use the following phrases interchangeably:</p>
<pre><code>- morality doesn't exist
- there are no moral facts
- morality is a social construct
- moral anti-realism is true
</code></pre>
<p>What this basically boils down to is the idea that morality is simply an idea or set of ideas. Any moral statement can ultimately be reduced to a statement of preference or opinion, nothing more. Furthermore, this means that moral disagreements are simply cultural differences or differences of opinion, meaning there is no definitive correct answer to these disagreements (no more than there can be a correct answer to which of two movies is better).</p>
<p>Now that we have a bit of an idea <em><strong>of</strong></em> the idea we’re dealing with, let’s get to some actual arguments. For me, it seems hard to ‘shake out’ the morality of any given situation when we analyze it closely. If we are to analyze a murder (for the sake of being as over the top and goulish as possible) how do we know something bad is happening? I can accurately describe and detail every piece of violence and gore in the scene, describe every gruesome bit of every part of a murder scene, but then I have to ask, where is the <strong>wrong</strong>, where is the <strong>bad</strong>, where is the <strong>evil</strong>. A person was alive, a knife went into their throat, and moment by moment, blood drained from their body and they stopped being alive.</p>
<p>If it is the case that something is FACTUALLY <em>wrong</em> about this series of events, that should be based on some sort of measurable quality of the situation that we can create a consistent understanding of and test for. It is my contention that no such test can exist. Terry Pratchet says</p>
<pre><code>TAKE THE UNIVERSE AND GRIND IT DOWN TO THE FINEST POWDER AND SIEVE IT THROUGH THE FINEST SIEVE AND THEN SHOW ME ONE ATOM OF JUSTICE, ONE MOLECULE OF MERCY.
</code></pre>
<p>I believe the same is true of evil and good. If goodness and/or badness factually existed, they should be measurable in some physical sense (or at least some sense at all), but it seems that this is just not true. As I said before, one could look at and accurately account for every fact about the situation, and no single fact or combination of facts would entail a moral judgement. More formally, I would make the following argument.</p>
<p><strong>FROM</strong><br>
P1: The factual basis of moral judgements rests on the capacity to detect and measure morality based on factual information.<br>
P2: No such capacity exists.<br>
<strong>IT FOLLOWS THAT</strong><br>
C: Moral facts do not exist.</p>
<p>I think that the best means of attacking this argument would be to cast doubt on premise 2. The most obvious attack being that there could be some capacity to make moral measurements that we are simply unaware of currently or do not have access to. This is conceivably true, and means that it is possible that moral facts do exist. I would argue that if we have so far been unable to find any way to measure these things, it seems unlikely that we ever will, even if it is theoretically possible. This also means that the BEST CASE for the moral realist is one in which they are hedging their bets on an unjustifiable assumption that we may or may not be able to verify at some point in the future.</p>
<h3 id="what-does-this-mean">What does this mean?</h3>
<p>If I’m right about any of the above analysis, this certainly carries <em>implications</em>. Where does that leave us normal people who have to get up and go to work and meet people and try to make something of our lives? Fortuntely (or unfortunately), I think we can still build out well reasoned moral systems and ideas, those ideas are simply not factual. To get there we have to build out a few assumptions and ideas, an important one being this: Moral statements are not statements of fact, but instead they are statements of subjective preference about the world.</p>
<p>From here, I’m going to try to build out a framework for what morality is and does. Let’s do some logic.</p>
<p><strong>FROM</strong><br>
P1: People exist.<br>
P2: People have preferences, ingrained or learned.<br>
P3: People, and their preferences, are significantly impacted by their experiences, environments, psychology, biology, etc.<br>
P4: People have diverse experiences, environments, psychology, biology, etc.<br>
<strong>IT FOLLOWS THAT</strong><br>
C: People have meaningfully different preferences<br>
<strong>FURTHERMORE, FROM</strong><br>
P1: People have meaningfully different preferences.<br>
P2: People have preferences of varying strengths. Including powerful preferences about how they or others should act.<br>
P3: Generally, people will advocate for their preferences in accordance to the strength of that preference.<br>
<strong>IT FOLLOW THAT</strong><br>
C: People will generally push for their strongly held preferences, explicitly to the detriment of the preferences of others.</p>
<p>I think from there, it seems entirely reasonable (and importantly, entirely descriptive) to read all of morality and even politics as a collection of social interactions large and small, where people advocate for and act out their preferences by whatever means they deem effective or necessary. This makes complete and total sense and is scary or comforting depending on your perspective.</p>
<p>I guess to conclude on this point, I’ll say two things. First, there is a way to make sense of morality and our moral thinking and decision-making without claiming that moral facts exist and I think thinking about it this way is more honest and helpful. Second, it may seem very scary to think that you have no ultimate justification for any moral position you hold, but it’s important to remember that nobody else does either.</p>
